# Regularization Techniques

This repository is a collection of educational resources focused on illustrating and implementing core regularization techniques used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

## Contents

The repository is organized by type of regularization:

- [`Ridge/`](https://github.com/Saransh-Basu-01/Regularization_techniques/tree/main/Ridge):  
  Implements Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization), demonstrating its impact on coefficient shrinkage and model performance.

- [`Lasso/`](https://github.com/Saransh-Basu-01/Regularization_techniques/tree/main/Lasso):  
  Contains resources and code for Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization), illustrating sparsity and feature selection.

- [`ElasticNet/`](https://github.com/Saransh-Basu-01/Regularization_techniques/tree/main/ElasticNet):  
  Explains and implements the Elastic Net method, which combines L1 and L2 penalties to balance their respective advantages.

## Purpose

- To serve as a hands-on reference for exploring regularization theory and practice.
- To provide code, visualizations, and commentary suitable for students and practitioners learning about machine learning regularization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saransh-Basu-01/Regularization_techniques.git
   cd Regularization_techniques
   ```
2. Explore subdirectories for notebooks or scripts related to each regularization method.
